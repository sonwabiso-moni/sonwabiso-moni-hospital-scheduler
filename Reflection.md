Reflection: 

  Difficulties in juggling stakeholder needs.
  Balancing stakeholder needs often involves managing competing priorities.   For example, hospital workers may require more time to manage complex schedules, whereas patients may require immediate access to available appointment times.   Another key issue was ensuring that the system could scale to handle high levels of traffic while maintaining security and performance.   Given the importance of data protection in the healthcare industry, balancing system performance and security proved especially difficult.   Stakeholder consultation is crucial for balancing demands and determining the most relevant components for each group.
