Reflection: 

  Difficulties in juggling stakeholder needs.
  Balancing stakeholder needs often involves managing competing priorities.   For example, hospital workers may require more time to manage complex schedules, whereas patients may require immediate access to available appointment times.   Another key issue was ensuring that the system could scale to handle high levels of traffic while maintaining security and performance.   Given the importance of data protection in the healthcare industry, balancing system performance and security proved especially difficult.   Stakeholder consultation is crucial for balancing demands and determining the most relevant components for each group.


## Updated Reflection 
In the course of this project phase, I have gained a better appreciation of how system design and requirements are driven by stakeholder requirements. Obtaining detailed functional and non-functional requirements has highlighted the difficulty in trading off technical feasibility and user expectations. A key insight has been the necessity of structuring requirements in such a way that usability, scalability, and security are assured without over-complicating the system. Additionally, use case and test case activity has been a valuable experience in defining system behavior and uncovering omissions in the initial requirements. The process has reaffirmed the importance of iteration in refining the project plan before starting development.

Despite these gains, there remain some challenges. Ensuring that all of the stakeholders' issues are covered while keeping the project scope realistic has been a question of careful prioritization. Certain issues, such as finding a balance between usability and security requirements, still need further refinement to produce a seamless user experience. Additionally, decomposing high-level system goals into detailed test cases has been an iterative process, underscoring the need for clarity and specificity. In the future, I would like to streamline the documentation process and further trace the requirements more closely to real-world constraints, so that the final system design is practical and flexible.
