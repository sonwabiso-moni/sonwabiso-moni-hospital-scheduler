Reflection: 

 Difficulties in Juggling Stakeholder Needs
 Managing competing priorities is a common step in balancing stakeholder needs.  For example, hospital employees may want additional time to handle complicated schedules, while patients may desire instant access to available appointment times.  Another major problem involved making sure the system could scale to accommodate large volumes of traffic without sacrificing security or performance.  Given how important data protection is in the healthcare industry, the trade-off between system performance and security proved particularly challenging.  It is importantÂ to balance these demands and rank the most important aspects for each group by consulting with stakeholders in great detail.
