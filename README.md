 ## Introduction.
 The Hospital Appointment Scheduler is a web-based solution that simplifies the process of scheduling, rescheduling, and cancelling hospital appointments.  This project, which focusses on the healthcare area, intends to reduce patient wait times and enhance hospital staff productivity by providing an intuitive online platform.

 Once completed, the system will allow patients to check available doctor schedules, make appointments, and receive confirmation messages, while hospital personnel will be able to manage calendars and track appointments in real time.
