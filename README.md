## Introduction
The Hospital Appointment Scheduler is a web-based system designed to streamline the process of booking, rescheduling, and canceling medical appointments. Targeting the healthcare domain, this project aims to reduce patient wait times and improve hospital staff efficiency by providing an intuitive online platform.

Once completed, the system will allow patients to view available doctor schedules, book appointments, and receive confirmation notifications, while hospital staff can manage schedules and track appointments in real-time.
