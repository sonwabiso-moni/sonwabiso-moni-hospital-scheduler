Non-Functional Requirements

Usability

The system must feature a user-friendly interface that enables users to schedule and manage appointments with minimal training required.  
Measurable Criteria: New users should be capable of scheduling an appointment within three minutes of their first interaction.

Deployability

The system must be deployable on both Windows and Linux server environments.  
Measurable Criteria: The system should function effectively on both platforms without any decline in performance.

Maintainability

The system must provide extensive documentation, including an API guide to facilitate future integrations.  
Measurable Criteria: The documentation should be sufficiently detailed for developers to integrate additional systems within a two-week timeframe.

Scalability

The system must accommodate up to 1,000 concurrent users during peak periods without compromising performance.  
Measurable Criteria: Response times should remain below three seconds for each user request during peak usage.

Security

All patient information must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption to adhere to healthcare data protection standards.  
Measurable Criteria: Patient data must be safeguarded and remain inaccessible to unauthorized individuals.

Performance

The system must process appointment bookings within two seconds of submission.  
Measurable Criteria: The response time for appointment submissions should not exceed two seconds.

Availability

The system must maintain an availability rate of 99.9%, excluding scheduled maintenance periods.  
Measurable Criteria: The system should ensure minimal downtime and provide uninterrupted service.

Interoperability

The system must facilitate data exchange with external systems through standard APIs.  
Measurable Criteria: The system should successfully exchange data with a minimum accuracy of 95% with external hospital systems.
